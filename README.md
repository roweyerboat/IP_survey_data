# Instruction Partners Survey Data Analysis

Given Instruction Partners Satisfaction Survey results, I have completed [Exploratory Data Analysis](IP_Survey_Data.ipynb) using python. I then created a [Tableau Public Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amanda.rowe/viz/InstructionPartnersAssignment/InstructionPartnersPresentation#4) as well as a Tableau workbook showcasing my findings in the data.
Answering the questions:

* How is our team performing?
* How are our partners feeling about our work?
* Across the organization, what are our bright spots?
* Do we have major outliers?
* What are the significant pattern or trends?
* How is the data changing over time?
