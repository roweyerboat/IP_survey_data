# Instruction Partners Survey Data Analysis

Given Instruction Partners Satisfaction Survey results, I have completed [Exploratory Data Analysis](IP_Survey_Data.ipynb)using python. I then created a [Tableau Public Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amanda.rowe/viz/InstructionPartnersAssignment/InstructionPartnersPresentation#4) as well as a Tableau workbook showcasing my findings in the data.
